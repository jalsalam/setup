# Git GUIs
My notes on comparing and contrasting a few graphical user interfaces for Git.

The ideal Git GUI:
* Steers you towards good workflows even if you don't fully understand what is happening under the hood.
* Allows the more advanced workflows that are good
* Makes authentication not-too-difficult
* Is usable across a range of scenarios (work/home, open/closed, personal/org accounts, https/ssh/etc.)

## Candidates

The GUIs I am examining are:
* GitKraken
* Sourcetree
* Git-Bash (from Git for Windows)
* Git-GUI (from Git for Windows)
* Github Desktop

Alternative scenarios:
* Accessing repos on github/jalsalam
* Accessing repos on github/jameelalsalam
* Accessing repos on github/USEPA
* Accessing repos on EPA test bitbucket server

### Sourcetree

* Uses global installed Git or can install or use portable version
* Version 2.6.9 (current on 7-11-2018) requires .NET 4.7.1, which is part of the Windows Fall Creators update

* Can authorize as an oauth app with Github or operate without that

Steps I have tried:
- clone a repo from github/jalsalam: Success!
